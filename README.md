Sub-C Compiler experiment

The goal is to follow the online book "A Compiler Writing Journey" :
https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj
and/or its external links, to experiment with a toy Sub-C compiler
targetting 16-bit Intel-compatible processors (eg: 8088)

To build, install vade :
https://github.com/nsauzede/vade

Then :
`$ vade clean build test`
